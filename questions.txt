 - Is future position automatically liquidated upon expiration?

 - Is trigger price same as limit?

 - Are ioc or post_only relevant in our order placements?
 
 - What to do if spot doesn't go through? entrance and exit

 - What to do if future order doesn't go through? entrance and exit

 Technical

 - What does get_positions response look like for spot assets / multiple assets


Edge Cases
 - Entering position
  - spot limit order is not filled - how long should we waitForConfirmation
  - spot order is partially filled - under what circumstances should we cancel the remaining
  - spot order is filled, future order is pending for 20+ seconds - market order? increase limit? ...
  - spot order is partially filled, partial future order is partially filled
  - spot order is filled fully, future order is partially filled (prolly same thing as above)


 TODO
  Enter position
  - place future sell at correct size (in usd or coin terms?) without waitForConfirmation
  - run confirmations after both orders placed
  - record action 

  - continue to monitor and exit

 - Test monitor positions before running enter_position
 - Execute strategy for when spread increases
 - waitForConfirmation when status is open for too long or 'new'




 If you have negative PNL below 30k, they will liquidate if you dont have collateral






Exit: <= 5%

Enter: 50th percentile

What is implied return if spot is higher end of margin and future is lower 

Solve margin where worst case return is 25% percentile

Make margin large enough so that order goes through with small order

If anything goes wrong, it gives text message
